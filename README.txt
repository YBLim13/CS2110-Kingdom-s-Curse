The GBA game is essentially a (very short) 2D platformer with the objective of beating 4 very simple enemies.
After all four enemies are defeated, the game is over and the player wins. If, however, the player loses
all his or her health before defeating the four enemies, the game is over and the player loses. The health is
tracked by the health meter at the bottom left of the screen and the player gains one life for each defeated enemy.

The controls are as follows:
LEFT, RIGHT: Movement along the x-axis
UP: Jump
DOWN: Crouch
A: Attack
B: Sprint (held)
L: Dash left
R: Dash right
START: Button to press on Start and Instructions Screen
SELECT: Soft resets and send player back to the Start Screen
